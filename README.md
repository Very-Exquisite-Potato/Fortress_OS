# Fortress OS

Description:

Fortress OS is an operating system built with Rust, Lua, Assembly, and Bash. It prioritizes extreme security while offering maximum customization for its users.

License:

This project is distributed without a license ("No License"), meaning that no one may copy, distribute, or modify the code or software without explicit permission from the author. Any violation of this policy will result in appropriate actions being taken.

Programming Languages and Frameworks:

Fortress OS is developed using:

Rust: Handles the core functionality and ensures security.

Lua: Provides user customization and styling capabilities.

Assembly: Interacts directly with hardware for critical features.

Bash: Powers the Command Line Interface (CLI).

The code may also be compiled to WebAssembly to streamline deployment. No frameworks are utilized, though this could change if needed.

Viewing the Program:

For security reasons, the source code will not be open for public viewing to prevent vulnerabilities and maintain Fortress OS's secure nature.

Editing the Program:

Contributors will have access to edit only non-critical parts of Fortress OS. Critical components will remain under the control of the author and a select group of trusted individuals. Unauthorized access requests will result in denial and potential blacklisting from the project.

How to Contribute:

To contribute to Fortress OS, message the author with your qualifications and areas of expertise. Suitable contributors will be granted access to approved components of the project. We aim to evaluate contributors within two years of the project launch.
